In the town of Athy one Jeremy Lanigan Battered away til he hadnt a pound.
His father died and made him a man again Left him a farm and ten acres of ground.
He gave a grand party for friends and relations Who didnt forget him when come to the will, And if youll but listen Ill make your eyes glisten Of the rows and the ructions of Lanigans Ball.
